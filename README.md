# buf-logger
Separate logging functions and interfaces in case you want to use the brainvr-reader but not the framework

Mostly kept in sync with the Brainvr.UnityFramework.Logger namespace from the [Brainvr unity framework](https://github.com/BrainVR/brainvr-unity-framework), but it implements few changes. Still works with the brainvr-reader.
